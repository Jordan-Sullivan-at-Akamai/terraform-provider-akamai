# resource_akamai_appsec_advanced_settings_evasive_path_match

**Scopes**: Security configuration; security policy

The `resource_akamai_appsec_advanced_settings_evasive_path_match` resource allows you to enable, disable, or update the evasive path match setting for a configuration.
This setting determines whether fuzzy matching is used to make URL matching more inclusive.
This operation applies at the configuration level, and therefore applies to all policies within a configuration.
You may override this setting for a particular policy by specifying the policy using the security_policy_id parameter.
