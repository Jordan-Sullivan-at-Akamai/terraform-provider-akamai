# akamai_appsec_penalty_box

**Scopes**: Security policy

Modifies the penalty box settings for a security policy.
When using automated attack groups, and when the penalty box is enabled, clients that trigger an attack group  are placed in the “penalty box”.
That means that, for the next 10 minutes, all requests from that client are ignored.
