data "akamai_appsec_configuration" "configuration" {
  name = "Documentation"
}
resource "akamai_appsec_eval_group" "eval_attack_group" {
  config_id           = data.akamai_appsec_configuration.configuration.config_id
  security_policy_id  = "gms1_134637"
  attack_group        = "SQL"
  attack_group_action = "deny"
